## **Phases of SDLC & Responsibilities in an Organization**

The SDLC consists of **six key phases**, each involving different teams and responsibilities.

---

## **1. Planning & Requirement Analysis**
### **What Happens in This Phase?**
- Understand business needs and objectives.
- Identify technical, operational, and financial feasibility.
- Define clear project goals and scope.

### **Who Handles It?**
- 👨‍💼 **Business Analysts (BAs):** Gather client needs and document requirements.
- 👩‍💼 **Project Managers (PMs):** Plan timelines, budget, and resources.
- 📈 **Stakeholders:** Define business goals and expectations.

### **🚀 Real-Time Example:**
A **bank** wants a **mobile banking app** with features like **secure login, real-time transactions, and bill payments**.  
👉 The Business Analyst gathers these requirements, and the Project Manager plans resources and timelines.

---

## **2. System Design**
### **What Happens in This Phase?**
- Create software architecture based on requirements.
- Define UI/UX, database structure, and technology stack.
- Ensure security and performance considerations.

### **Who Handles It?**
- 🧑‍💻 **System Architects:** Define software architecture.
- 🎨 **UI/UX Designers:** Design the user interface for a smooth experience.
- 💾 **Database Administrators (DBAs):** Plan secure and efficient database structures.

### **🚀 Real-Time Example:**
For the **banking app**, the team decides on:
- **Frontend:** React Native for cross-platform mobile support.
- **Backend:** Node.js for API handling.
- **Database:** MySQL for secure transactions.

---

## **3. Implementation (Coding & Development)**
### **What Happens in This Phase?**
- Develop software according to design specifications.
- Implement business logic, APIs, and database connections.
- Maintain version control for smooth collaboration.

### **Who Handles It?**
- 👨‍💻 **Frontend Developers:** Build the user interface using React, Angular, etc.
- 👩‍💻 **Backend Developers:** Develop APIs and server logic using Java, Python, or Node.js.
- 💾 **Database Developers:** Implement data storage and security features.
- ⚙️ **DevOps Engineers:** Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.

### **🚀 Real-Time Example:**
For the **banking app**, developers create:
- **Login System:** Secure authentication using **OAuth & bcrypt**.
- **Fund Transfer API:** Encrypt transactions for security.
- **Push Notifications:** Send alerts after each transaction.

---

## **4. Testing**
### **What Happens in This Phase?**
- Identify and fix bugs before deployment.
- Perform **functional, performance, security, and integration** testing.
- Ensure compliance with industry standards.

### **Who Handles It?**
- 🔍 **QA Testers:** Perform manual and automated testing.
- 🔒 **Security Analysts:** Check for vulnerabilities like SQL injection.
- ⚡ **Performance Engineers:** Optimize software performance.

### **🚀 Real-Time Example:**
For the **banking app**, testers check:
- **Login System:** Can hackers bypass authentication?
- **Transaction Module:** Does the balance update correctly?
- **App Speed:** Does it load in under 3 seconds?

---

## **5. Deployment**
### **What Happens in This Phase?**
- Deploy the application to live production servers.
- Monitor for real-world issues and fix urgent bugs.
- Ensure **zero-downtime** updates.

### **Who Handles It?**
- ☁️ **DevOps Engineers:** Manage cloud deployment and security.
- 🛠️ **System Administrators:** Handle server configurations.
- 📢 **Release Managers:** Oversee deployment strategy.

### **🚀 Real-Time Example:**
For the **banking app**, the bank launches:
- **Google Play Store & Apple App Store releases.**
- **Web Portal for online banking.**
- **Live transaction testing with real accounts.**

---

## **6. Maintenance & Updates**
### **What Happens in This Phase?**
- Fix bugs reported by users.
- Roll out security patches and performance improvements.
- Add new features based on user feedback.

### **Who Handles It?**
- 🛠️ **Support Engineers:** Monitor software and fix urgent bugs.
- 🧑‍💻 **Developers:** Work on feature updates and performance improvements.
- 📞 **Customer Support Team:** Collect feedback from users.

### **🚀 Real-Time Example:**
A month after launching the **banking app**, the bank notices:
- Users request **dark mode** → Developers add it.
- High-traffic **transaction failures** → DevOps engineers scale the server.
