   ```

### **`pgrep` – Process Grep**  
`pgrep` is a Linux command that searches for processes based on their **name** and returns their **Process ID (PID)**. It’s more efficient than `ps aux | grep` because it directly queries the system’s process table.

---

### **Basic Usage**
```bash
pgrep myapp
```
🔹 Finds and prints the PID of **all running** processes with the name `myapp`.  

---

### **Common Options**
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-x` | Matches **exact** process name. (`pgrep -x nginx` won’t match `nginx-worker`) |
| `-l` | Shows **PID and process name** (`pgrep -l nginx`) |
| `-u user` | Finds processes running under a specific **user** (`pgrep -u root`) |
| `-f` | Searches for processes **including full command line** (`pgrep -f "python myscript.py"`) |

---

### **Example Usage**
#### **1️⃣ Find the PID of `nginx`**
```bash
pgrep -x nginx
```
✔ Returns **only** the main `nginx` process PID.

#### **2️⃣ Find PIDs of all Java processes**
```bash
pgrep -l java
```
✔ Shows **all** running Java processes with their names.

#### **3️⃣ Kill a process using `pgrep`**
```bash
kill -9 $(pgrep -x myapp)
```
✔ Finds and forcefully **kills** `myapp`.

---

   Traces system calls of process `1234`.
