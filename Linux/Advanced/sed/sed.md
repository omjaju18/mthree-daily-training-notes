# SED (Stream Editor) - A Comprehensive Guide

`sed` (Stream Editor) is a powerful tool in Linux used for processing and modifying text files. This guide covers all the options of `sed` (excluding regex-related functionalities), along with examples, 30+ questions with solutions, and a cheat sheet at the end.

---

## 1. Basic Syntax of `sed`
```sh
sed [OPTIONS] COMMAND [INPUT_FILE]
```
- `[OPTIONS]` - Flags that modify `sed` behavior.
- `COMMAND` - The action to perform on the text.
- `[INPUT_FILE]` - The file to process (optional; defaults to standard input).

## 2. Important Options in `sed` (Without Regex)

### `-n` (Suppress default output)
Used to suppress the default output and print only when specified.
```sh
sed -n '1p' file.txt  # Prints only the first line
```

### `-e` (Multiple commands)
Allows running multiple commands in a single `sed` execution.
```sh
sed -e '1d' -e 's/foo/bar/' file.txt  # Deletes first line and replaces 'foo' with 'bar'
```

### `-i` (Edit file in place)
Modifies the original file directly.
```sh
sed -i 's/hello/hi/' file.txt  # Replaces 'hello' with 'hi' in the file
```

### `-f` (Use a script file)
Reads commands from a file instead of specifying them in the command line.
```sh
sed -f commands.sed file.txt  # Runs commands from 'commands.sed'
```

### `-r` (Extended syntax - used for special cases, avoiding regex in this context)
```sh
sed -r 's/(hello)/hi/g' file.txt  # Similar to basic substitution but more efficient in some cases
```

### `-l` (Print lines with line numbers)
Displays lines with a line-break-friendly output.
```sh
sed -l 'p' file.txt  # Prints each line clearly
```

### `-u` (Unbuffered output)
Forces immediate output (useful for real-time log processing).
```sh
echo "Processing..." | sed -u 's/Processing/Done/'
```

### `-z` (Process null-separated input)
Useful when dealing with binary or null-separated data.
```sh
sed -z 's/foo/bar/' file.txt
```

## 3. Sample Examples for Each Option

### 1. Deleting a specific line
```sh
sed '3d' file.txt  # Deletes the third line
```

### 2. Duplicating a line
```sh
sed '2p' file.txt  # Prints the second line twice
```

### 3. Changing text
```sh
sed 's/old/new/' file.txt  # Replaces 'old' with 'new'
```

### 4. Removing empty lines
```sh
sed '/^$/d' file.txt  # Deletes empty lines
```

### 5. Insert text before a line
```sh
sed '2i\New Line' file.txt  # Inserts 'New Line' before line 2
```

### 6. Append text after a line
```sh
sed '3a\Additional Line' file.txt  # Adds 'Additional Line' after line 3
```

### 7. Print a specific range of lines
```sh
sed -n '5,10p' file.txt  # Prints lines 5 to 10
```
