# 📌 Foreign Key in SQL – A Complete Guide

A **Foreign Key** is a constraint in SQL that enforces **referential integrity** between two tables. It ensures that a value in the child table must exist in the parent table, preventing orphaned records and maintaining data consistency.

---

## 🔹 What is a Foreign Key?
A **Foreign Key (FK)** is a column or a combination of columns that establishes a link between two tables.

### ✅ Key Characteristics:
- A **foreign key** references a column (usually **PRIMARY KEY**) in another table.
- It ensures **referential integrity** (i.e., no orphaned records).
- The referenced column in the parent table must have **unique values** (i.e., it must be a PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE).
- You can define actions like `CASCADE`, `SET NULL`, `RESTRICT`, and `NO ACTION` on **UPDATE** and **DELETE** events.

---

## 🔹 Creating Tables with Foreign Key
We create two tables:
1️⃣ **Departments** → **Parent Table** (Holds department details)  
2️⃣ **Employees** → **Child Table** (References `DeptID` from `Departments`)

```sql
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DeptID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DeptName VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    DeptID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DeptID) REFERENCES Departments(DeptID)
);
```

---

## 🔹 Inserting Data Correctly ✅
```sql
INSERT INTO Departments VALUES (1, 'IT'), (2, 'HR'), (3, 'Finance');
INSERT INTO Employees VALUES (101, 'Alice', 1), (102, 'Bob', 2), (103, 'Charlie', 3);
```
👉 Data is inserted successfully because `DeptID` values exist in `Departments`.

---

## 🔹 Violating Foreign Key Constraint ❌
```sql
INSERT INTO Employees VALUES (104, 'David', 5);
```
🔴 **Error**:  
```
ERROR: Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails.
```
🔍 **Why?**  
1. `DeptID = 5` does **not exist** in `Departments`.  
2. The **foreign key prevents invalid references**.

---

## 🛠️ Foreign Key with ON DELETE and ON UPDATE Actions
### Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    DeptID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DeptID) REFERENCES Departments(DeptID)
    ON DELETE CASCADE
    ON UPDATE CASCADE;
);
```

### ✅ How It Works:
- **`ON DELETE CASCADE`** → If a department is deleted, all employees in that department are **also deleted**.
- **`ON UPDATE CASCADE`** → If a department ID is updated, the update is **reflected** in `Employees`.

---

## 🔹 ON DELETE Actions
| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **CASCADE** | Deletes child records when the parent record is deleted. |
| **SET NULL** | Sets the foreign key column in the child table to `NULL`. |
| **RESTRICT** | Prevents deletion if references exist. |
| **NO ACTION** | Similar to `RESTRICT` but enforced at the end of a transaction. |

---

## 🔹 ON UPDATE Actions
| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **CASCADE** | Updates foreign key values in child table if parent key changes. |
| **SET NULL** | Sets foreign key in the child table to `NULL` when parent key updates. |
| **RESTRICT** | Prevents update if foreign key references exist. |
| **NO ACTION** | Similar to `RESTRICT` but enforced at the end of a transaction. |

---

## 🔹 Why Use Foreign Keys?
✔ **Data Integrity** → Prevents orphaned records.  
✔ **Cascading Actions** → Automates changes for consistency.  
✔ **Data Relationships** → Enforces logical links between tables.  
✔ **Prevents Inconsistent Updates** → Ensures that dependent data stays correct.  

---

## 📌 Summary
- A **foreign key** establishes a relationship between two tables.
- `ON DELETE` & `ON UPDATE` control behavior when referenced records change.
- **CASCADE** propagates changes (**deletion or update**).
- **SET NULL** ensures data remains but removes the reference.
- **RESTRICT/NO ACTION** prevent changes if dependencies exist.

🚀 **Foreign keys maintain consistency and integrity in relational databases!**

## 📌 Entity-Relationship Diagram (ER Diagram)  
An **ER Diagram (ERD)** is a **visual representation** of a database structure, showing how different entities (**tables**) relate to each other.

### 🔹 Components of an ER Diagram:
- **Entities** → Represent objects in the database (e.g., Employees, Departments).
- **Attributes** → Properties of entities (e.g., Employee Name, Salary).
- **Primary Key (PK)** → Uniquely identifies an entity (e.g., `EmpID` in Employee).
- **Foreign Key (FK)** → Links two entities (e.g., `DeptID` in Employee referring to Department).
- **Relationships** → Connects entities (e.g., "Works In" relationship between Employee and Department).

### 🔹 Example ER Diagram:
```
+-------------+        +--------------+
|  Employee   |        |  Department  |
|-------------|        |--------------|
| EmpID (PK)  | -----> | DeptID (PK)  |
| Name        |        | DeptName      |
| Salary      |        +--------------+
| DeptID (FK) |
+-------------+
```
✔ `DeptID` in **Employee** is a **foreign key** referring to `DeptID` in **Department**.  
✔ **One Department** can have **many Employees** (**1:M relationship**).

## 📌 Database Normalization Explained  
**Normalization** organizes data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity.

| **Normal Form** | **Key Rule** |
|---------------|------------|
| **1NF** | Atomic values (no multi-valued columns) |
| **2NF** | No partial dependency (non-key attributes depend on full primary key) |
| **3NF** | No transitive dependency (non-key attributes do not depend on another non-key attribute) |
| **BCNF** | Every determinant must be a candidate key |

## 📌 Stored Procedure in SQL: A Complete Guide  
A **stored procedure** is a precompiled set of SQL statements stored in a database.

### 🔹 Why Use Stored Procedures?
✔ **Reusability** → Write once, use multiple times.  
✔ **Performance Boost** → Reduces parsing and compilation overhead.  
✔ **Security** → Can restrict access and prevent SQL injection.  
✔ **Encapsulation** → Groups logic inside a single unit.  
✔ **Reduces Network Traffic** → One execution is faster than multiple queries.  

### 🔹 Example:
```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE GetAllEmployees()
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM Employees;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```
✅ **Usage**: `CALL GetAllEmployees();`  
👉 Fetches all records from the `Employees` table.

---

## 📌 Conclusion
Foreign keys **enforce referential integrity**, prevent **inconsistent updates**, and help manage **data relationships** efficiently. Understanding **ER diagrams**, **normalization**, and **stored procedures** can further optimize database design.

Would you like an **ER diagram** to visualize normalization better? 🚀
