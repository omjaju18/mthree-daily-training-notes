# ACID Properties Explained with Alice & Bob's Bank Transactions

ACID properties ensure reliable and secure transactions in databases. ACID stands for:

1. **Atomicity** â€“ All or nothing
2. **Consistency** â€“ Valid state before and after the transaction
3. **Isolation** â€“ Transactions execute independently
4. **Durability** â€“ Changes persist permanently

## 1. Atomicity â€“ "All or Nothing"
**Example:**
- Alice wants to transfer â‚¹5000 to Bob.
- The transaction involves two operations:
  1. Deduct â‚¹5000 from Aliceâ€™s account.
  2. Add â‚¹5000 to Bobâ€™s account.

**Issue Without Atomicity:**
- If the system crashes after deducting money from Alice but before adding it to Bobâ€™s account, Bob never receives the amount, causing inconsistency.

**How Atomicity Solves It:**
- If **both operations succeed**, the transaction is **committed**.
- If **either operation fails**, the transaction is **rolled back**, restoring Aliceâ€™s balance to â‚¹10,000.

âœ… **Ensures Aliceâ€™s money doesnâ€™t disappear.**

## 2. Consistency â€“ "Valid State Before & After Transaction"
**Example:**
- The bank follows a rule: **Total money in the system must remain the same**.
- Initially:
  - Alice has â‚¹10,000.
  - Bob has â‚¹5,000.
  - **Total = â‚¹15,000.**
- After Alice transfers â‚¹5000, balances should be:
  - Alice: â‚¹5000
  - Bob: â‚¹10,000
  - **Total = â‚¹15,000 (unchanged).**

**Issue Without Consistency:**
- If Bobâ€™s balance is updated incorrectly (e.g., receives â‚¹6000 instead of â‚¹5000), the total money becomes â‚¹16,000, violating banking rules.

âœ… **Ensures no incorrect changes in data.**

---

## 3. Isolation â€“ "Transactions Donâ€™t Interfere"
**Example:**
- Suppose Alice and Bob both try to withdraw â‚¹5000 simultaneously from the same account (â‚¹10,000 balance).

**Issue Without Isolation:**
- If both withdrawals check the balance at the same time (â‚¹10,000), they may both proceed, leading to â‚¹10,000 being deducted twice, resulting in **â‚¹0 instead of â‚¹5000 left**.

**How Isolation Solves It:**
- The system **processes one transaction at a time**.
- If Aliceâ€™s transaction is being processed, Bobâ€™s transaction **must wait** until Aliceâ€™s transaction is complete.

âœ… **Prevents incorrect balance calculations due to simultaneous actions.**

---

## 4. Durability â€“ "Once Committed, It's Permanent"
**Example:**
- Alice successfully transfers â‚¹5000 to Bob.
- A sudden **power failure** occurs immediately after the transaction.

**Issue Without Durability:**
- If the system crashes, Bobâ€™s updated balance might be lost, and it may appear as if he never received the money.

**How Durability Solves It:**
- The bankâ€™s database ensures that once the transfer is **successfully completed**, it **remains saved** permanently.
- When the system restarts, Bobâ€™s account still shows the updated balance.

âœ… **Ensures transaction data isnâ€™t lost after completion.**

## ðŸ”¹ Summary: How ACID Properties Help in Banking

| **ACID Property** | **Ensures in Alice & Bob's Example** |
|------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Atomicity** | If Aliceâ€™s money is deducted, Bob must receive it (or rollback). |
| **Consistency** | Total money in the system remains correct before & after. |
| **Isolation** | No two transactions interfere, preventing race conditions. |
| **Durability** | Transaction remains saved even after a system crash. |

âœ… **ACID properties make banking transactions safe, reliable, and error-free.**
